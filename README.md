Clarity — A Mindful Browser Extension to Break Digital Patterns

Clarity is a browser extension that gently disrupts harmful digital patterns like doomscrolling, tab overload, and social media overuse. Built for a digital wellbeing hackathon, it encourages reflection, healthy breaks, and intentional screen time — without being invasive.

📈 Today’s Progress — see how many times you took intentional breaks.

🔁 Tab Switching Detection — detects rapid tab switching and prompts you to pause.

📜 Doomscrolling Insights — track your most scrolled sites and total scroll time.

⚙️ Custom Scroll Settings — control how long you scroll before a popup nudges you.

🚨 Focus Mode — detects visits to social sites and reminds you to stay on track.

🧘 Deep Breath Prompts — subtle, calming reminders to reset.
